# Gestion de datos

## prerequisites

1. Run `docker compose up` using this config [docker-compose.yaml]( https://github.com/dhasane/gestion-datos/blob/main/docker-compose.yml ), this creates a container running Postgres.
2. Run this [jupyter notebook]( https://github.com/dhasane/gestion-datos/blob/main/entrega.ipynb ), this cleans the data and stores it into the database. This notebook consumes two files artists.csv and tracks.csv.

2. Run `poetry install`.
